# ADR-0104: Exactly-once modes use service-native replay protection and pass a performance gate

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-13
- Issues: [#591](https://github.com/laughingman7743/flink-connector-gcp/issues/591)
- Modules: bigquery, pubsub, cloudtasks, bigtable, spanner
- Current behavior: `docs/content/docs/connectors/delivery-guarantees.md`

## Context

Only the BigQuery sink implements Flink committer and writer-state interfaces.
Its exactly-once Storage Write API method persists each active destination's BUFFERED stream and
next explicit append offset, emits a committable at a checkpoint, and calls `FlushRows` after
checkpoint completion.
This differs deliberately from BigQuery's COMMITTED-stream example because rows appended before a
Flink checkpoint must remain invisible if Flink restores an earlier checkpoint.
ADR-0022 records that stream lifecycle.

The Pub/Sub, Cloud Tasks, Bigtable, and Spanner sinks are stateless writers.
They flush outstanding requests before a checkpoint barrier, which makes a completed checkpoint a
durability boundary but does not stop a restored job from submitting the same record again.
Adding a Flink committer around those eager APIs would not retract an effect already visible at the
service.

The destination services expose different replay primitives and therefore cannot inherit one
meaningful two-phase-commit abstraction:

- Pub/Sub assigns the published message ID and documents exactly-once delivery for pull
  subscriptions, not publisher request deduplication.
- Cloud Tasks accepts a caller-chosen task ID and rejects a recently used ID with `ALREADY_EXISTS`,
  but task handlers still execute at least once.
- Bigtable can conditionally mutate one row atomically when an application profile routes to one
  cluster and explicitly enables single-row transactions.
- Spanner `BatchWrite` has no replay protection, while a short read-write transaction can atomically
  bind a ledger marker to effects in the same database.

Correctness alone is insufficient for a public mode.
Conditional reads, task-name lookups, and transactional ledgers can reduce throughput or increase
tail latency enough to make a nominal guarantee impractical.
Issue #591 therefore preregistered correctness, performance, and variability gates before any
real-service measurement.

## Decision

**Do not add a common two-phase-commit layer to the non-BigQuery sinks.**
A new exactly-once or effectively-once mode is eligible only when the destination has a replay-safe
primitive that atomically binds a stable application event identity to the protected effect.
The mechanism may be an eager idempotent or transactional write; it does not have to be a Flink
two-phase commit.

The connector documentation distinguishes four boundaries:

- checkpoint durability;
- at-least-once submission;
- an idempotent or bounded effectively-once destination effect; and
- an exactly-once service write, which still does not establish end-to-end exactly-once processing.

The connector-specific decisions are:

- **BigQuery remains the only checkpoint-coordinated exactly-once sink.**
  Its buffered-stream implementation uses the same offset replay protection as the official
  committed-stream example but adds checkpoint-controlled visibility.
- **Pub/Sub publisher-side exactly-once is declined as a connector-only feature.**
  A producer event attribute can support downstream deduplication, but the topic can still contain
  duplicate physical messages.
- **Cloud Tasks retains bounded effectively-once task creation only.**
  `taskIdExtractor(...)` supplies the stable identity and `ALREADY_EXISTS` is successful creation
  within the service's name-retention window.
  The handler remains at least once, and no broader guarantee is claimed.
- **The Bigtable same-row marker candidate is correctness-feasible but performance-inconclusive,
  and is not a supported connector mode.**
  Every protected mutation and its marker must share a row, the application profile must use
  single-cluster routing with transactional writes enabled, and marker retention must exceed the
  replay horizon.
  Multi-row effects are outside this candidate.
- **Only the Spanner 100-record ledger-transaction shape remains correctness-feasible, but its
  performance result is inconclusive and it is not a supported connector mode.**
  The ledger and effects must share a database and a short read-write transaction.
  The connector must not keep a transaction open across a Flink checkpoint.

Bigtable and Spanner must repeat Stage 1 with evenly distributed keys.
Cloud Tasks must repeat Stage 1 until its run-to-run variation is within the preregistered limit.
Passing Stage 1 is permission to measure Stage 2, not permission to implement.
Stage 2 requires separate resource and cost approval and covers 64 KiB payloads, hot keys,
concurrency and Flink parallelism 1, 4, and 16, and checkpoint intervals 1, 10, and 60 seconds.
An implementation that passes requires a connector-specific ADR to settle identity, schema or
marker ownership, retention, failure routing, recovery tests, and operational limits.

The preregistered support thresholds remain the decision rule:

| Outcome | Throughput against baseline | Candidate p95 against baseline |
|---|---:|---:|
| General support | at least 70% | no more than 2x |
| Constrained opt-in | at least 25% | no more than 4x |
| Decline | below 25% | or above 4x |

Correctness is a prerequisite.
Each cell has a warm-up and three measured repetitions, and a throughput range greater than 10% of
the mean is inconclusive.

## Evidence

### Implementation and contract audit

The audit used `libraries-bom` 26.85.1 and the connector sources on 2026-08-13.
Only the two BigQuery exactly-once methods create committers or persist sink writer state.
The other writers wait for acknowledged requests in `flush()` and persist no sink state.

The service contracts support the boundaries above:

- [BigQuery's Storage Write API guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api-streaming)
  uses explicit offsets for exactly-once appends and demonstrates a COMMITTED stream.
- [Pub/Sub exactly-once delivery](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/exactly-once-delivery) is a
  pull-subscription feature and warns that multiple publisher calls can still produce multiple
  messages.
- [Cloud Tasks task creation](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.queues.tasks/create)
  documents caller-specified ID deduplication, `ALREADY_EXISTS`, retention of recently used names,
  and increased lookup latency.
- [Bigtable writes](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/writes#conditional) and
  [routing](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/routing#single-row-transactions) constrain
  conditional atomicity to one row and single-cluster transactional routing.
- [Spanner batch write](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/batch-write) explicitly has no replay
  protection, while [read-write transactions](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/transactions)
  atomically apply reads and writes and can abort when left idle.

Local correctness probes on 2026-08-13 submitted each candidate twice.
The Bigtable emulator observed one same-row effect and one marker after a conditional replay.
The Spanner emulator observed one non-idempotent increment and one ledger row after transactional
replay.
The existing Cloud Tasks integration case ran five task-creation tests, including deterministic-ID
replay and `ALREADY_EXISTS` normalization.

### Stage 1 real-service measurement

Stage 1 intended to use 1 KiB evenly distributed records and bounded client concurrency.
The three services ran sequentially, every billable target was deleted after its run, and each
target was reported absent after cleanup.
These are service-client measurements, not end-to-end Flink measurements.

- Bigtable used one SSD node in `us-central1-b`, one single-cluster transactional application
  profile, concurrency 1,000, 10-second warm-ups, and three 30-second repetitions per arm.
- Spanner used a Standard regional `us-central1` instance with 100 processing units, concurrency
  16, 10-second warm-ups, and three 30-second repetitions per arm.
- Cloud Tasks used one paused `us-central1` queue, concurrency 1,000, 5,000-task warm-ups, and three
  50,000-task repetitions per arm.

| Service and arm | Throughput repetitions | p95 latency repetitions | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bigtable bulk baseline | 4,931 / 4,788 / 4,875 ops/s | 233 / 246 / 224 ms | Baseline |
| Bigtable same-row conditional marker | 5,736 / 5,825 / 5,865 ops/s | 203 / 182 / 178 ms | Ratios met the general thresholds; formal result inconclusive |
| Spanner `BatchWrite(100)` baseline | 8,896 / 8,703 / 8,651 records/s | 201 / 207 / 210 ms | Baseline |
| Spanner ledger transaction, 1 record | 47.7 / 48.9 / 49.0 records/s | 347 / 343 / 342 ms | Declined |
| Spanner ledger transaction, 10 records | 439 / 471 / 440 records/s | 478 / 484 / 485 ms | Declined |
| Spanner ledger transaction, 100 records | 3,826 / 3,840 / 4,029 records/s | 731 / 656 / 539 ms | Ratios met the constrained thresholds; formal result inconclusive |
| Cloud Tasks unnamed baseline | 383.8 / 391.8 / 404.5 tasks/s | 3,288 / 2,849 / 2,692 ms | Baseline |
| Cloud Tasks deterministic task ID | 402.0 / 389.9 / 360.2 tasks/s | 2,765 / 2,987 / 5,217 ms | Inconclusive: 10.9% throughput range |

Evidence review found that the Bigtable and Spanner harness used unique but lexicographically
increasing keys rather than the preregistered evenly distributed keys.
Their ratios are observations, not formal gate passes.
Both Stage 1 results are inconclusive and require a compliant repeat before Stage 2.
No repeat ran because it requires new resource and cost approval.

The Bigtable candidate throughput range was 2.2% of its mean, and the baseline range was 2.9%.
The 10% replay arms measured 5,808--5,857 ops/s and preserved one effect and marker per event.
A concurrency-one control measured 6.0 ops/s and demonstrated that the harness detected a known
throughput regression.

The Spanner 100-record candidate throughput range was 5.2% of its mean.
Its 10% replay arm measured 4,554 records/s and preserved one effect and ledger row per event.
The serialized control measured 292 records/s.

The Cloud Tasks candidate averaged 97.6% of baseline throughput and 1.24x baseline p95, but its
10.9% throughput range exceeded the preregistered limit.
The result is inconclusive rather than a pass.
Its 10% replay arm measured 409 tasks/s, and duplicate names returned `ALREADY_EXISTS` without a
second task creation.
The paused queue dispatched no handlers, and the serialized control measured 4.5 tasks/s.
No extra repetition ran because it would have exceeded the approved operation count and cost
estimate.

## Alternatives declined

- **Add `SupportsCommitter` to every sink** — a committer cannot hide or retract an eager publish,
  task creation, row mutation, or batch write that the service has already made visible.
- **Call producer event IDs Pub/Sub exactly-once** — downstream deduplication can protect a consumer
  effect, but does not prevent duplicate messages in the topic.
- **Keep a Spanner transaction open from pre-commit to checkpoint completion** — the source offset
  is not part of that transaction, Flink checkpoints can outlive the transaction, and Spanner can
  abort idle read-write transactions.
- **Implement Bigtable or Spanner from the observed Stage 1 ratios** — the key-distribution
  deviation prevents a formal Stage 1 pass, and Stage 1 does not measure Flink recovery,
  checkpoint interval, hot-key contention, large payloads, or the connector's failure-routing
  semantics.
- **Treat the Cloud Tasks averages as a pass** — doing so would discard the variability rule after
  observing its result and turn a preregistered gate into post-hoc judgment.

## Consequences

- User documentation states what each current sink guarantees without equating checkpoint flush,
  idempotence, two-phase commit, and end-to-end exactly-once processing.
- BigQuery's BUFFERED-stream implementation is documented as related to, but not a copy of, the
  official COMMITTED-stream example.
- Pub/Sub has no connector-only implementation issue to pursue.
- Cloud Tasks keeps its existing bounded creation guarantee and needs a separately approved Stage 1
  repeat before any performance recommendation changes.
- Bigtable and batched Spanner may receive compliant Stage 1 repeats.
  Only a passing repeat permits a separate Stage 2 investigation.
  Their eventual implementation sessions, if any, own their detailed ADRs and public APIs.
- No unsupported exactly-once mode is added by this documentation decision.
